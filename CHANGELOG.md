# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased Changes

## 2.0.0 - 2017-09-08
### Changed
- React.DOM is now DOM as per React's deprecation warnings for v16

## 1.0.1 - 2015-10-30
### Fixed
- transform crashes on files without any React Jade code within.

## 1.0.0 - 2015-10-30
### Added
- production commitment

### Changed
- parsing is done in an isolated manner, so custom syntax is allowed to exist
  outside the React Jade strings. The key benefit of this is languages that
  cannot be parsed by Esprima, such as typescript, can be transformed before
  going through their compiler, keeping typechecking intact.
- babel Plugin is no longer separate operations, use reactJade.babel 'before'
  using the standard babel transformations.

## 0.5.0 - 2015-10-28
### Added
- babel plugin support added. For posterity, I'm actually completely okay with
  putting plugins for babel, browserify, etc inside this repo. Splitting it
  for less code than text in the README.md seems counter-productive.

## 0.4.0 - 2015-08-03
### Added
- `this` is now bound (using Function.bind) to switch and map function
  expressions (kinda embarrasing I didn't think of it sooner).
- `this` is now added to the preparation step's string, which allows it to be
  tracked even if an intermediate step assigns `this` to another variable (any
  fat arrow transpiler does this when targeting ES5)

## 0.3.1 - 2015-07-31
### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect literal detection for jade attributes that are string
  concatenations, for example:

  a(
    title="Prefix " + this.props.value + " Suffix"
  )

## 0.3.0 - 2015-06-06
### Added
- Added support for &attributes for DOM elements and Components
- Added support for unescaped HTML for DOM elements.

## 0.2.0 - 2015-03-23
### Added
- Basic File Diff Tests
- Documentation Reference

## 0.1.12 - 2015-03-21
### Fixed
- Fixed regression introduced, literals incorrectly build for code generator.

## 0.1.11 - 2015-03-21
### Added
- String Classes and Calculated Classes (ie React.addons.classSet) can now
  be safely mixed.
- Object Literals can be used as attributes.
- Components Argument can now be used in place of attribute properties, for
  example: +Component(propsObject)

### Fixed
- Properties written as Literals rather than Identifier, so you can now use
  attributes such as "data-foo".
